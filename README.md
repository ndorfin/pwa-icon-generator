# PWA Icon generator

This shell script helps you generate all the associated add-to-home-screen icons for a progressive web app from a few source images.

## Compatibility

Almost every known touch-icon is generated by this tool, and includes:

- iOS: apple-touch-icon-*
- Android (Chrome): touch-icon-*
- Windows (Edge): ms-touch-icon-*

## Installation

TBD

## Usage

### Requirements

Before you can use this script, **you'll need at least one source image** to work from, but it'll be better if you supply two or more source images to work from.

The sizes you should use include:

1. 256 x 256 (Most important)
1. 64 x 64
1. 128 x 128
1. 512 x 512 (Least important)

TBD

## Setting up your web environment

Place all the generated PNGs in your webroot: `/`. That's it!

### Aren't the `<meta>` and `<link>` elements requried?

Nope. Each handset will request a particular file name from the affected website's webroot, e.g.: `GET /apple-touch-icon.png`. There's no need to list each file in your document's `<head>`.
